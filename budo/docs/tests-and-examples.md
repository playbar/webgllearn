# tests and examples

To run the bud≈ç tests or example from source, first clone the repo and install its dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mattdesl/budo.git
cd budo
npm install
```

The tasks are run with the `"scripts"` field in [package.json](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo/blob/master/package.json).

## running tests

Now you can run the following to see the unit tests:

```sh
npm test
```

## running the examples

See the [package.json](../package.json) `"scripts"` field for how these work.

#### basic

To run the example:

```sh
npm start
```

Now when you open `localhost:9966` you should see a simple 2D canvas scene with an image. If you update the `example/index.js` source, you will see watchify emitting logs in the console. Refreshing the page will show the new bundle.

#### live reload

To run the example with live reloading:

```sh
npm run live
```

Again, open `localhost:9966` and try making changes to `example/app.js`, `example/index.html` or `example/theme.css`. The CSS should be injected without a page refresh, and HTML/JS content will trigger a page reload. 

## other examples

#### LESS on the fly

See [budo-less](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo-less) for an example of how you can integrate LESS into budo, giving you the same rapid development cycle and CSS injection without any need to write files to disk during development.
